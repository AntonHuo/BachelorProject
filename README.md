We used 6 different machine learning algorithms to predict finacial fraud.

1.Run restatements.py to get restatements for each company per year.

2.Run testdatei.py to get data for each company per year.

3.Run testdateimitlabels.py to combine the restatements and data

4.run trainingdata_audit_analytics.py to combine the effect and data

5.now you can run 6 different algorithms.
